The project focused on developing a Hindi text summarization model using the transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The goal was to create a system that can generate concise and meaningful summaries from lengthy Hindi texts, catering to the unique linguistic features of the language.

Key tasks included designing the model, preprocessing the text data, and implementing various machine learning techniques using TensorFlow. The project involved evaluating the model's performance with metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU to ensure high-quality output.

The successful implementation of the model demonstrated its ability to effectively handle and summarize diverse Hindi text inputs, contributing valuable insights and advancements in the field of Machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
